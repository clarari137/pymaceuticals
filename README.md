In this module challenge, we are analyzing a dataset from a drug trial on mouse tumors. 

## Sources
- I mainly relied on the starter code and the class examples demonstrating the charting methods and regression analysis. 
- I used the following website for assistance wit Cell 3, finding duplicates: https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-get-list-of-all-duplicate-rows/
- I got assistance from AskBCS on two questions.The first being dropping the duplicate mouse using .loc instead of .drop_duplicates, and the second was rewriting my quartiles/outliers section using groupby instead of filtering the dataset. This meant my new dataset only had one point per mouse instead of keeping all of the data for each. 
- Finally I used https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/statistics/boxplot.html for help with the boxplot customizations.
